# DictionaryADT
Dictionary ADT 
This program recreates a previously created Dictionary ADT but with hash tables instead of a linked list data structure. 

The use of hash tables in this program creates a key and value pair array where the ADT then allows a user to search up specific values associated with a key. Dictionary.c is the implementation file while there are test files and makefiles included in this program.
